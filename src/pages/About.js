            <p>
                Team Ray is a student-led aerospace society at the University of Huddersfield. 
                Our mission is to inspire innovation and creativity through participation in the Olympus Trials, 
                a simulated Mars rover competition.
            </p>
            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>
                We aim to design, build, and operate a rover capable of navigating Martian-like terrain, 
                solving engineering challenges, and analyzing geological features. 
                Our team fosters collaboration, skill development, and a passion for exploration.
            </p>
            <h2>The Olympus Trials</h2>
            <p>
                The Olympus Trials is an annual competition where student teams from around the world 
                test their engineering and problem-solving skills by creating rovers to navigate simulated Martian terrain.
